**Super Nintendo スーパーファミコン development**

-----

[Examples](https://github.com/michielvoo/SNES/tree/master/examples) and [documentation](https://github.com/michielvoo/SNES/wiki) for developing programs in 65816 assembly for the [Super Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) (known as the Super Famicom or スーパーファミコン in Japan).

All examples have been tested and are know to work in the [higan Super Nintendo emulator](http://byuu.org/emulation/higan/), but [some examples](https://github.com/michielvoo/SNES/issues) do not currently work on real hardware.
