To build the example programs, you need to install [WLA DX](http://www.villehelin.com/wla.html), an assembler for [65816 processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65816/65802) that comes with special directives for assembling code into Super Nintendo ROMs.

A build script for Unix-like systems is included in this directory. It has only been tested on OS X Yosemite (10.10). The following command, when executed from the `src` directory, builds a program:

    ./build.sh sprite/program.asm

The main output is a ROM file located at `sprite/sprite.rom`. Other build artifacts include listings generated by the assembler.

After assembly of the program has finished without errors, the build script attempts to locate a script called `upload.sh`. When found, this script is invoked with the ROM file as its only argument. You should provide your own upload script to upload the ROM to a device or emulator. (The build script itself does not accommodate the use of copiers or flash cartridges.) 

An upload script for [OpenEmu](http://openemu.org/) on OS X is provided in `upload-openemu.sh`.

To remove all build artifacts and intermediate files produced by the build process from all subdirectories, run `./clean.sh` from the `src` directory.
